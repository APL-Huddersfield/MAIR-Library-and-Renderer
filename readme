# MAIR Library Rendering Tool
MAIR is an open-access library of an extensive set of room impulse responses (RIRs) captured using numerous microphone arrays from 2-channel stereo to 9-channel surround with height. The RIRs were obtained for 13 loudspeakers placed in various positions on a stage in a reverberant concert hall. The library features five 2-channel stereo pairs, 10 main surround arrays, nine height microphone arrays for 3D main arrays and 15 4-channel configurations for surround and 3D ambience arrays, each with varied microphone polar patterns, directions, spacings, and heights. A dummy head and a first-order-Ambisonics microphone are also included. The library is provided with a rendering tool, with which the user can easily simulate different microphone combinations in both loudspeaker and binaural playback for 13 source positions. The audio inputs for the rendering tool can be directly fed from a DAW session as well as by manual file allocation.
